            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>We will further agree, That no House shall pay above Six Shillings a Year, and that every such Dwelling, or other House, in which Trade is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on, and that so payeth, shall have the Benefit of the Light, reaching and shining as far in the Street or Lane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where they dwell, as their Door, or Passage into it; and after the same Manner, every Street, Lane, Alley, Court, Square, Yard, or other Places, shall be enlightened, having at least one Lamp within Thirty Yards distance of each House.</p>
            <p>And that all Churches, Halls, Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall pay after the Rate of Eight Shillings a Year, and no more.</p>
            <p>We will also agree, That the said Lighting yearly, shall be continued from the Twentieth of <hi>September,</hi> to the Twentieth of <hi>April;</hi> and that they always be maintained only with Rape-Oil, and Cotton-Wick, and that they shall begin to be lighted at Candle-lighting, or as soon as it begins to be dark; and that they shall be kept burning clear, each Night, untill Twelve of the Clock, or so much as shall not be enlightened by the Moon; and that the Glasses shall be cleaned every Day, and the Lights snuffed every Night, as often as there shall be occasion.</p>
            <p>And it shall be agreed, That the said Lights shall yearly be of the same Dimentions and Goodness as the Pattern to be given in.</p>
            <p>And for further Encouragement to the City to give a Grant hereof, We will be obliged to pay the Lord Mayor and Commonalty, the Sum of <hi>Eight Hundred Pounds</hi> yearly, on the Twentieth of <hi>May;</hi> they obliging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, not to permit any other Publick Lights to be set up in the City, during the Time of their Grant.</p>
